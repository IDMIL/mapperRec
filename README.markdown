# mapperRec

This is a small libmapper program that checks if there are any interesting
signals on the network.  When it finds one, it creates a corresponding signal on
a local device, and requests a direct mapping.  It then records any received
information to one of several back-ends.

The back-ends currently implemented are:

- A text file writer.
- A binary file writer.
- A writer that forwards the data to [Andy Schmeder's OSCStreamDB][1], which
writes it to a Postgresql database.

Currently, "interesting signals" are defined as any output signal that matches a
given device name.  So it can be used to record all output signals of a device.
In the future this might be better defined using a more complex matching
strategy, a command line, or a GUI-based selection.

Recording to SDIF/GDIF would be a nice enhancement too.
